# Heart Disease Prediction with Logistic Regression

This project uses a machine learning model to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on several medical attributes.


## Features Used
- `age`: Age of the person
- `sex`: Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)
- `cp`: Chest pain type (0–3)
- `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
- `chol`: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)
- `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results (0–2)
- `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved
- `exang`: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise
- `slope`: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0–2)
- `ca`: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0–3)
- `thal`: Thalassemia status (0 = normal, 1 = fixed defect, 2 = reversible defect)
- `target`: Presence of heart disease (1 = has disease, 0 = no disease)

## Predict Using with Your Input
